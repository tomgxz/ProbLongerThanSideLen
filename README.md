Imagine a square of side length s.

Choose two points at random on the outside edge of the square, A and B.

Imagine the straight line connecting A and B.

What is the probability that the distance AB is greater than s?
- Create a simulation to run many tests on this and estimate the probability.

If you complete this you may either:
- Create a visualisation to show each iteration of the process, or
- Attempt the problem analytically.  The maths isn't that complicated, but it may involves some approaches you haven't seen.
